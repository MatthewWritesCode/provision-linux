# scripts
Full of utilities for maintaining my personal devices. Mostly scripts for automatic backups and updates.

Server utilities are in folders for there platform. Some utilities have install scripts for standardized setup. Uninstall scripts should be updated to properly uninstall anything added by the install script. Some things may require confirmation (delete saved games? y/n).
